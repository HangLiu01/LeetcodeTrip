[33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/)
## 2023/07/23
Since the question asks to build the algorithm to O(logn). The first come into my mind is to use binary search algorithm. I think it is the correct one to use, though I still spent a while on some edge case. One edge case I mis-considered is when there are two numbers left in the subarray. 
For example, [3,1]. Follow the code, left = 3, mid = 3, right = 1. before the correction, this line was: ```if target < nums[left] and nums[left] < nums[mid]:``` I did not use ```<=``` for the second condition. Therefore, it will narrow my subarray in a wrong side, which after one iteration, 
left = 3, right = 3, mid = 3. 
It is relatively complicated without writing out each step and just thinking the process in my head.

class Solution(object):
    def search(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1
        
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + int(math.floor((right - left) / 2))
            if target == nums[mid]:
                return mid
            if target < nums[mid]:
                if target < nums[left] and nums[left] <= nums[mid]:
                    left = mid + 1
                else:
                    right = mid - 1
            else:
                if target > nums[right] and nums[right] >= nums[mid]:
                    right = mid - 1
                else:
                    left = mid + 1

        return -1
```
