[70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/description/)
## 2023/07/26
It took me awhile to think about the question. I think I still need more practice on dp problem. I used recursion for my first try but it failed due to time exceed. Therefore, I created a dictionary to store existed numbers instead of having them running to the base case for every number. Though I did not use a dp to solve the problem. I just called it dp cuz i dont know what to name.

class Solution(object):
    def climbStairs(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        dp = {}
        dp[0]= 1
        dp[1] = 1

        return self.helper(n, dp)
    def helper(self, n, dp):
        if n not in dp:
            dp[n] = self.helper(n-1, dp) + self.helper(n-2, dp)
        return dp[n]
