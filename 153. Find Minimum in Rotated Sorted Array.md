## 2023/07/22
This one is a classic binary search problem. Starting comparing the mid idx and its right most element, if rightmost element is smaller, it means the smallest val is in the right side from the mid. dont forget to reset the mid in order to process further search.

class Solution(object):
    def findMin(self, nums):
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1

        while left < right:
            mid = left + int(math.floor((right - left) / 2))
            if nums[mid] > nums[right]:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid

        return nums[left]
