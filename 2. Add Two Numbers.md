[2. Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)
## 2022/06/04
Forgot about linked list at first. Spend some time to review. 

One key point is that the question actually wants you to return the first node in linked-list (maybe I'm just dumb)

So I created a dummy node and set a pointer cur to track every node down. Using while loop and boolean condition to make sure that
as long as one of them is not the last node, the work continues. 

Set a flag '''plus''' to make sure add 1 to cur_value when flag is on (plus=1). **Make sure to check the flag after while loop. Because if the flag is on, we need
to create a new node with value 1 and append it.**

Something stops me awhile is the last part when check the condition whether current node is None. If leave it as '''l1 = l1.next''' If it turns None
after the last node. The process will cause problem because '''None does not have .next''' Tried to make it simple but it seems like the first time hitting
None is a tricky point to handle.

(does longer runtime always has a low memory usage? It seems right for me. Maybe using more memory usage can make it more effcient?)

        dummy = ListNode(0)
        cur = dummy
        plus = 0
        while (l1 != None or l2 != None):
            if l1 == None:
                cur_value = l2.val
            elif l2 == None:
                cur_value = l1.val
            else:
                cur_value = l1.val + l2.val
            if plus == 1:
                cur_value += 1
                plus = 0
            if cur_value >= 10:
                cur_value = cur_value % 10
                plus = 1
            cur.next = ListNode(cur_value)
            cur = cur.next

                l1 = None
            else:

            if l2 == None:
                l2 = None
            else:
                l2 = l2.next
        if plus == 1:
            cur.next = ListNode(plus)
        return dummy.next
