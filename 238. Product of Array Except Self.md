[238. Product of Array Except Self](https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/description/)
## 2023/07/23
Since the question asks for a solution with O(n), i decided to use several loops to create 1. an array stores all left products 2. an arrary stores all right products. and the last one is to compute the product combined. There's def a lot that can be improved. For example, I think i can dynamically store the second
array. Like using one loop to process both final product and update right side product continuously. In that way, the memory usage should be improved.

class Solution(object):
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        cnt = len(nums)
        left = []
        ans = []
        right = [1]*cnt
        for i in range(0, cnt):
            if i == 0:
                left.append(1)
            else:
                left.append(left[i-1]*nums[i-1])
        j = cnt - 2
        while j >=0:
            right[j] = right[j+1] * nums[j+1]
            j = j - 1
        for i in range(0, cnt):
            ans.append(left[i] * right[i])
        return ans
```
