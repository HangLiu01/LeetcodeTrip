[53. Maximum Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)
## 2022/10/21
I tried to use the same logic as I solved Q121, but kinda get stuck while designing the algorithm. Then I also used brute force(two for loop) also failed at the time
limit exceeding. Look at the solution and found the 'Kadane Algorithm' which used mostly for Dynamic Programming. Need more practice to master this algorithm.

def maxSubArray(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        cur_max, max_till_now = 0, float('-inf')
        for c in nums:
            cur_max = max(c, cur_max + c)
            max_till_now = max(max_till_now, cur_max)
        return max_till_now
