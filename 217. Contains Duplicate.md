[217. Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)
## 2022/10/22
Used brute force solution at first with one loop. However, received answer of exceed time limit. I think the problem may occur on count(). After googling for the time
compelxity for count(), realized that it would loop through the list every time I called it. So it is not really efficient. 

After looking into discussion under this question, I noticed that someone uses set() to keep track of the list, once there was a duplicate in set, it would return False. 
After googling, realized that the ```in``` operator in python is O(1), which surprises me. Guess I should use in more often. 

**Brute Force:**
---
```
Time Limit Exceeding
def containsDuplicate(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        for t in nums:
            if nums.count(t) > 1:
                return True
        return False
```

**Use of Set and in operator:**
