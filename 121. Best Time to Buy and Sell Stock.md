[121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/))
## 2022/10/20
I tried this first yesterday(2022/10/19) but failed at the Time Limit Exceeding(using Brute Force). After looking into the dicussion under the question. Found a simpler one
which uses single for loop and set two conditions one for min price and one for the max profit.

```
def maxProfit(self, prices):
        """
        :type prices: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        min_price = float('inf')
        max_profit = 0
        for i in prices:
            if i < min_price:
                min_price = i
            elif (i - min_price) > max_profit:
                max_profit = i - min_price
        return max_profit
```
