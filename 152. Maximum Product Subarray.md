[152. Maximum Product Subarray](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-subarray/description/)
## 2023/07/21
Haven't updated for a while. Completely forgot this repo :(
Back with a dp problem, thought it would be similar to [53. Maximum Subarray](https://github.com/HangLiu01/LeetcodeTrip/blob/main/53.%20Maximum%20Subarray.md), however it needs to consider more cases like when there are two negatives in the list.

After multiple tries, the logic is to keep tracking not only the max sub value but also the min sub value. In such way, we are be able to track the edge case when we have even negatives in our array.

class Solution(object):
    def maxProduct(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        result = max_val = min_val = nums[0]
        for i in range(1,len(nums)):
            n = nums[i]
            temp = max(n, n*max_val, n*min_val)
            min_val = min(n, n*max_val, n*min_val)
            max_val = temp
            result = max(result, max_val)
        return result
```
